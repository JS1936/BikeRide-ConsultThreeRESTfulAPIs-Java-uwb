# BikeRide-ConsultThreeRESTfulAPIs-Java-uwb #
This project was a school assignment. It gave me further practice with APIs, and introduced me to exponential-backoff.

# Purpose #
Practice using multiple RESTful APIs in a single program. Implements exponential-backoff upon unexpected API call feedback.   <br><br> The user can search a city and learn its temperature in Fahrenheit, Air Quality Index (AQI), and local bike rental services. This information is intended to help the user decide whether or not to take a bike ride that day, in that city. 

# Setup and Usage #
1. Clone the project to local device, open in IntelliJ
2. To run the project: in IntelliJ, open terminal. Do "./build.sh"
3. To run custom/manually: adjust build.sh file tests (change the city) or run those commands from console
